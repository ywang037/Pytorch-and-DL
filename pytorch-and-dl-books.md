# PyTorch and Deep Learning books

There are several good books on this PyTorch and DL, I picked some good ones and list them as below:

1.  *Deep Learning with PyTorch*, Luca Pietro Giovanni Antiga, Thomas Viehmann, Eli Stevens, Manning Publication 2020.

    This book is published in July 2020, and is the newest one I found so far. This might be the **best one** also.

    * PDF can be downloaded from this <a href="https://pytorch.org/assets/deep-learning/Deep-Learning-with-PyTorch.pdf">link</a>
    * Github code resources can be found <a href="https://github.com/deep-learning-with-pytorch/dlwpt-code">here</a> 
    * A shorter companion book on the *Essential Excerpts* can be found <a href="https://github.com/bat67/pytorch-tutorials-examples-and-books/blob/master/books-and-slides/Deep-Learning-with-PyTorch.pdf">here</a>


2. *Programming PyTorch for Deep Learning*, Ian Pointer, O'Reilly 2019.

    This 2019 book might be a little bit outdated, but it has received good reviews on Amazon.

3. *PyTorch Recipes: A Problem-Solution Approach*, Pradeepta Mishra, apress, 2019

    This is the book that I am currently studying. It seems to be a little bit outdated though.
