# Pytorch-and-DL
In this repo, I will learn, practice, and do data science and DL works with PyTorch

## PyTorch and Deep Learning books

There are several good books on this PyTorch and DL, I picked some good ones and list them as below:

1.  *Deep Learning with PyTorch*, Luca Pietro Giovanni Antiga, Thomas Viehmann, Eli Stevens, Manning Publication 2020.

    This book is published in July 2020, and is the newest one I found so far. This might be the **best one** also. 
    * Book page and related description is <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/deep-learning-with/9781617295263/">here</a>
    * PDF can be downloaded from this <a href="https://pytorch.org/assets/deep-learning/Deep-Learning-with-PyTorch.pdf">link</a>
    * Github code resources can be found <a href="https://github.com/deep-learning-with-pytorch/dlwpt-code">here</a> 
    * A shorter companion book on the *Essential Excerpts* can be found <a href="https://github.com/bat67/pytorch-tutorials-examples-and-books/blob/master/books-and-slides/Deep-Learning-with-PyTorch.pdf">here</a>


2. *Programming PyTorch for Deep Learning*, Ian Pointer, O'Reilly 2019.

    This 2019 book might be a little bit outdated, but it has received good reviews on Amazon.
    * Book page and related description is <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-pytorch-for/9781492045342/">here</a>
    * Github code resources is <a href="https://github.com/falloutdurham/beginners-pytorch-deep-learning">here</a>


3. *PyTorch Recipes: A Problem-Solution Approach*, Pradeepta Mishra, apress, 2019

    This is the book that I am currently studying. It seems to be a little bit outdated though.
    * Book page and related description is <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/pytorch-recipes-a/9781484242582/">here</a>
    * PDF can be downloaded from this <a href="https://github.com/bat67/pytorch-tutorials-examples-and-books/tree/master/books-and-slides">link</a>, there are a lot of other books (with PDF downloadable) and learning resources in this github repository.

4. *Deep Learning with PyTorch Quick Start Guide*, David Julian, Packt Publishing 2018

    This 2018 book can be outdated also, but it receives good reviews on Amazon. It is easy to read, a good entry-level guidelines to PyTorch, and **may be better** than the previous book.
